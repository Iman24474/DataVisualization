# 1. Make a scatterplot of `bill_depth_mm` vs. `bill_length_mm`. That is, make a scatterplot with `bill_depth_mm` on the y-axis and `bill_length_mm` on the x-axis. Describe the relationship between these two variables.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(penguins,
       mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm,
                     y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_point()

```
